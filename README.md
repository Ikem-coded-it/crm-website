Welcome!
I am excited to welcome you to this project ðŸ¤—.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 13 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for CRM's website using the `pages` directory.

This project is a revamp of the already existing website <https://crm-world.org.ng/> and seeks to show how WordPress can be used as a de-coupled CMS backend for a Next.js website.

If you have some experience with or wish to strengthen your skills in: WordPress, Next.js, Tailwind and Typescript, then this is the right project for you.
Practice / grow your skills while contributing to a real-world project.
